# Hello world

I am a Full Stack Engineer, focusing more on meta-skills than hard-skills. I like **GPLv3** way too much & in my free time I work on my own open source platforms.

# You can help me by donating

I am maintaining and hosting my open source projects myself and that takes time and money. Starting from development time, domain names & consent management for compliant cookie storage. You can use these services for free.

However, if you find my work useful and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating more useful things, you can donate:

[![BuyMeACoffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20a%20Coffee-ffdd00?style=for-the-badge&logo=buy-me-a-coffee&logoColor=black)](https://buymeacoffee.com/reard)

I will put that money towards the projects' hosting costs and also buy myself a coffee.
